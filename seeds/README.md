# Seeds Directory

In the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/he1lonice/waflgo) provided by the authors, they have only provided the seeds for jpg files. Seeds of other forms are not available.

According to the [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/xiang-yi), they used the original seeds of the project being fuzzed and the seeds of the [Unifuzz project](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/li-yuwei), which were released in this [Github repository](https://github.com/unifuzz/seeds).

This directory contains the seeds that were collected through the method described in the paper.

Since the image already contains the jpg seeds, this directory won't contain them.
